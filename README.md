# Personal Portfolio Website

This was a project that had a few goals:

1. Create a portfolio website to showcase all the work I can do as well as showcase my ability to handle web development.
2. Create a site that had a squarespace feel with none of the cost.
3. Learn to use JQuery and Vanilla JS

## Guide

Most of the files are obviously named but I'm just going to explain what a few files (mostly javascript ones) do to allow you to go through and rip out parts o the code you may want for yourself.

* webp.js detects if the browser the site is being run on can support WebP files and that is used in mainjquery.js to change the loaded background image on the homepage
* mainjavascript.js
